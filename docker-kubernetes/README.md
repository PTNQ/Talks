# Concordia TechTalk - Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

The talk is scheduled for December 13th 2020 at 6:00 PM EST.

## Abstract

Since the start of Docker in 2013, containers have become widely adopted by most tech companies as a way to efficiently develop and deploy software in production. For instance, Google, the original author of Kubernetes, deploys all of its services in containers.

In this talk, we will be going over the basic concepts of containers, and how to deploy a simple REST API written in Go inside of a Docker container. We will then go over Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, which can automatically manage and deploy containers across multiple machines. We will use Kubernetes to deploy our REST API application inside a cluster while exposing the required endpoints to the outside world using Ingress. Afterwards, we will briefly go over Helm, a packaging tool for Kubernetes deployments. Finally, we will take a glimpse into how Docker and Kubernetes can be secured.
